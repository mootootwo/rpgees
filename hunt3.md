# HUNT

Nestled into the countryside is a small, pastoral village. In it, small people live out their small lives much as they have for a thousand years. But something now skulks in shadows.

Three people throw themselves into peril to protect this community. Decide what is worth this risk, and what they will sacrifice for the village and for each other.

## Intro

Hunt is a role playing game where four players immerse themselves in a wild chase, a search for a monster. 

Play proceeds through four phases: Establishing, Investigation, Confrontation, and Epilogue.

Three players form the Party, taking on the roles of the heroes of the story. During the game the Party will build the physical embodiment of the hunt for the monster, a **Trail** of connected dominoes that weave and fork to represent different threads and challenges. 

The remaining player is the Hunt Master who, like the Game Master in other RPGs, will build the story by posing challenges for the Party.

### Components

You will need:
- 4 players
- 1 set of standard Double Twelve dominoes
- 3 differently colored tokens to represent the players (coins, pebbles, or origami can serve)
- Pencils for taking notes
- either butcher paper for taking notes as you lay down your trail
- or sticky-notes to use for the same
- A few hours

### Concepts

#### Void

The face-down pool of unallocated dominoes, full of potential and the dark unknown

#### Token

A small representative object that represents an individual member of the Party

#### Trail

This is the main trail of the story. It tells the tale of the village and its prosperity and woes. Every domino placed on the Trail represents a **Stake** that the Party might make sacrifices on behalf of. The concerns of small people, and their small lives.

#### Branch

During Investigation and Confrontation phases, branches are established off of the main **Trail**. These serve to either locate the monster (during the Investigation phase) or to combat it (during Confrontation). 

#### Stake

Every domino placed by a player during the Establishing phase represents a stake. Something they might risk their own health and safety to preserve, and which will be accounted for during the Confrontation.

#### Playing Dominos

To be played, the domino must be able to connect up with a domino already on the table by matching one of its numbers. It can be placed in a line parallel to the existing domino, with the matching numbers joined end-to-end. Or, in the case of doubles, dominos may be placed perpendicular with a matching end touching the center-line of the double domino.

During the Investigation and Confrontation phases, any matched ends of dominos may be treated as doubles for the purpose of establishing branches.

## Establishing Phase

This phase provides the foundation for the adventure. The Hunt Master uses the Establishing phase to "set the stage", creating interest in the village and its inhabitants. The Party uses this phase to explore the world, introduce their characters, and set up their **Stakes** for the game.

### Setup

If using butcher paper to take notes, unroll enough to cover your play surface (where the dominos will be placed) and tape or weigh down the corners. Otherwise, simply prepare a clean surface for the dominoes and counters and any sort of sticky-notes or other note taking mechanism.

The Hunt Master finds the double 12 tile, the double 11 tile, and the double 10 tile and keeps them for now.

Flip all of the remaining dominoes so they sit face down on the table. Shuffle them. This is the **Void**.

Each member of the Party draws 6 dominos from the **Void**. They may arrange these as they wish so that they can see their own and no one else's.

Each member of the Party also chooses a player **token** to represent themselves on the **Trail**.

### Play

#### The Village

The Establishing phase begins with the Hunt Master describing the village and placing a representation of it on the table.

The Hunt Master draws a domino to determine the village name, and another to determine the basis of the village economy. Each domino has 2 numbers and each table has 2 sides. The Hunt Master may use the numbers on the dominoes in either order when consulting the tables:

> Village Name
> --------------------
>     0  - Avon - berg
>     1  - Ben  - bury
>     2  - Crag - combe
>     3  - Cul  - dale
>     4  - Dal  - firth
>     5  - Hop  - ford
>     6  - Inns - glen
>     7  - Lang - ham
>     8  - Lin  - keth
>     9  - Mere - mouth
>     10 - Pen  - pool
>     11 - Sten - stow
>     12 - Win  - whel

> Village Economy
> --------------------
>     0  - cabbage   - baskets
>     1  - chalk     - beer
>     2  - clay      - bees
>     3  - clams     - festivals
>     4  - coal      - flowers
>     5  - fish      - fox hunts
>     6  - horses    - herbs
>     7  - onions    - historical tourism
>     8  - peat      - holiday crafts
>     9  - pigs      - pheasant hunts
>     10 - sheep     - poets
>     11 - turnips   - socks
>     12 - whale oil - whiskey

From the village name and economy, the Hunt Master may extrapolate more details about the village's surroundings and population as they wish. When satisfied, the Hunt Master returns those two dominos to the **Void**.

The Hunt Master continues by drawing a single domino at random from the **Void** and placing it in the middle of the table. This domino represents the village and the beginning of what will become the **Trail**.

If both sides of the domino are 8 or above, something exciting and positive is happening in the village. If both numbers are 7 or below, some unfortunate (but mundane) event as affected the town. If the numbers are mixed, events are somewhere in between.

The Hunt Master makes a note by the domino -- either by writing on the butcher paper or by placing sticky-notes -- noting what happenings the sides represent.

#### The Party

Party members may introduce their characters and establish **Stakes** in any order, and need not wait until other players have played a domino before they play another.

The creation of characters is very freeform but there are some guidelines. Party members will create characters that fit in the village established by the Hunt Master. They may be local or visiting but they should make sense in the world and care about the village. When the village is threatened by a dangerous monster, they will have a compelling reason to stand up and fight instead of flee.

When they feel so inclined (and when they have a domino that can be played), a member of the Party joins the game by playing a domino and describing their character.

To represent their place in town, the Party member places their character **Token** on the domino that they just played and describes the sort of events the character is involved in.

Similar to the initial domino laid down by the Hunt Master, the number on the unmatched side of the domino determines the kind of story beat the character is experiencing. If the number is 8 or above, it is a positive experience. If it 7 or below, it is a more difficult experience.

Any party members may join the game when they are ready by playing a domino either on the exposed end of the last domino. This indicates that they are involved in the same chain of events depicted when the last domino was played, can continue from any notes made at that point.

A party member may also match the other number on the initial domino, or may match an available double domino. This indicates that they are somewhere else in the village, involved in scenes not directly connected to the other series of events.

#### The Stakes

Each domino placed in this way will determine something that the party member is invested in, and will risk themselves to protect.

Every domino placed must describe something of importance to the party member. Something that drew them to the village, or about their family or passion or vision or values.

If a player places a domino where another party member's token is already standing, this represents a **Stake** that they share. Their stories intertwine here, and they both feel the same investment. Shared **Stakes** may be resolved by _either_ player during the Confrontation phase.

Make note of each **Stake** near the domino where it is played.

For every **Stake** that is offered up to risk in this way, the player draws two dominos from the **Void**.


#### Ending Phase

Once all players have placed their **Token**, and as soon as a 10 is available at one of the **Trail** ends, the Hunt Master places the double 10 perpendicular on the matching end and signal the presence of the monster.

The Hunt Master describes how the monster's presence is first known to the Party. This will be evidence of something dangerous and weird but the monster itself does not yet appear. There could be footprints, a reported sighting, or possibly even an attack occurring somewhere the Party is not.

To help describe what evidence the monster might have left, and to eventually reveal the monster in the Confrontation phase, the Hunt Master draws two dominos and consults the following table. These details may not be fully known to the Party, and can be revealed over time:

> Monster's Body Shape
> --------------------
>     0  - Luminous     - Plant
>     1  - Gaseous      - Fungus
>     2  - Flat         - Mollusk
>     3  - Amorphous    - Cephalopod
>     4  - Serpentine   - Fish
>     5  - Bipedal      - Crustacean
>     6  - Quadrupedal  - Spider
>     7  - Eight-limbed - Insect
>     8  - Centipedal   - Reptile
>     9  - Skeletal     - Bird
>     10 - Mechanical   - Mammal
>     11 - Tiny         - Humanoid
>     12 - Enormous     - Combination (draw again, use this table twice)

> Monster Movement and Feature
> --------------------
>     0  - Slithering     - Projectiles
>     1  - Tunneling      - Claws
>     2  - Swimming       - Prehensile tongue
>     3  - Creeping       - Sharp teeth
>     4  - Wall-crawling  - Spikes
>     5  - Leaping        - Tail
>     6  - Flying         - Tentacles
>     7  - Floating       - Mind control
>     8  - Phasing        - Burning touch
>     9  - Shadow-walking - Glowing eyes
>     10 - Dream-walking  - Multiple faces
>     11 - Teleporting    - Slime
>     12 - Combination    - Combination (draw again, use this table twice)

After the double 10 has been played and the monster's presence is revealed, the Establishing phase ends and the game progresses to the Investigation phase.

## Investigation Phase

During the Investigation phase, the Party will attempt to research and track their quary, learning how it might be defeated.

This can be done through talking with supporting characters, tracking, setting traps, or other investigative tactics as developed by the Party. The Hunt Master's job is to continue dropping exciting evidence about the monster's presence and activities.

The Party's goal during the Investigation phase is to locate the monster as efficiently as possible, without depleting all of their available resources (in the form of dominos).

### Setup

Briefly, before the Investigation phase proper begins, the players all need to solidify some choices about their characters.

The Hunt Master decides what kind of monster they have in the story. 3 different classes of monster are listed below, each of which offers unique abilities.

- Secretive: Not much is known about these creatures. Investigation phase branches are 3 to 5 tiles long (instead of 2 to 3). 
- Sturdy: These creatures are heavily armored. Dominos drawn from the **Void** in the Show-down phase branches is reduced by 1.
- Slippery: These creatures are difficult to pin down. Show-down phase branches are exactly 4 tiles long (instead of 2 to 3).

Similarly, Party members choose a class and ability that reflect their character's strengths in hunting this monster.

The Detective: Your investigative power is unmatched. Choose 1 of the following abilities:

- Head Start: Draw 2 tiles at the start of the Investigation phase.
- Brains over Brawn: When you successfully complete an Investigation phase **Branch**, draw 3 tiles instead of 2.

The Hunter: Trained for 1-on-1 combat, you are a master of taking out the enemy. Choose 1 of the following abilities:

- Born for Blood: Draw 2 tiles at the start of the Show-down Phase.
- Lone Wolf: When you succeed at a Show-down **Branch** and you did not receive help, you draw 4 dominos from the **Void** instead of 2.

The Hunt Master adds the double 11 domino into the **Void** and shuffles it.

### Play

#### Turn Order

Unlike the freeform nature of previous phases, during the Investigation each player must take a turn in order. Begin with the player holding the most dominos (count pips or determine another tiebreaker if needed) and proceed clockwise. Party members will play dominos and describe scenes where there character is investigating the monster.

The Hunt Master, on their turn, describes the actions of the monster -- always just out of the Party's grasp. It will wreak havoc around the village and threaten the stakes that the party is invested in.

#### Branches

In addition to playing dominos on the exposed ends of the Trail, the Party may play dominos branching off of other points along the main Trail. To create a **Branch**, Party members add a third tile to an existing matched pair. For example, if there are two 6's linked on the board, a player with the 6|8 tile can link the 6's up to create a branch with an available end valued of 8.

The player that created the **Branch** should put their token at the end of it on the last placed domino. This becomes their **Branch**, and only they can play tiles on it. This splitting of the Party represents the desperate rush to discover clues about the monster, before greater damage is done.

A branch is successful if it is 2 or 3 tiles long (or 3 to 5 tiles, if it is a Secretive monster) and ends with a number of 8 or higher. A successful Investigation always yields useful information for the hunt and 2 bonus tiles for that **Branch's** player. (If the player has Brains over Brawn, reward 3 tiles instead)

#### Further Stakes

If additional dominos are played on the main trail, move the player token appropriately and establish an additional stake. Do not reward any dominos to the Party member after the stake is established.

#### Damage

If it is a Party member's turn and they need to play a domino -- but they do not have one that matches any available space on the **Trail**, they describe their character suffering some kind of damage. This could be physical injury or stress. They also discard 2 of their dominos (randomly selected by the Hunt Master) back into the **Void** and search the **Void** (randomly drawing and discarding) until they find a domino they can play.

#### Death

If at any point a Party member has no dominos, their character has perished. If death doesn't suit the story, the character might be driven to hopelessness by the struggle and flee the village, abandoning their **Stakes**. One way or the other, the character is out of the game.

#### Ending Phase

The Investigation phase ends when a Party member locates the double 11 domino in the **Void** and plays it on the main Trail of the hunt. At that point the Hunt Master describes the Party coming into direct contact with the monster for the first time and the game progresses to the Confrontation phase.

## Confrontation Phase

During the Confrontation, the Hunt Master reveals the monster in all of its terrible capability.

The Party tries to protect each of the **Stakes** they created in the establishment phase, while still destroying the monster before it kills them.

### Setup

Remove all the dominos from the branches off the main **Trail** and return them to the **Void**.

The Hunt Master adds the double 12 domino into the **Void** and shuffles it.

Party members with the Born for Blood ability draw 2 tiles

### Play

#### Branches

During the Confrontation, **Branches** represent wrestling with the creature itself. Like in the Investigation phase, **Branches** may be added by playing a third tile perpendicular to an existing matched pair.

Unlike the Investigation phase, multiple Party members may play dominoes on a **Branch** cooperatively, both placing their **Tokens** on the same **Branch**.

Successful **Branches** result in damage to the creature, in the form of the Party member drawing 2 dominos from the Void (or 4 if a Lone Wolf completed a branch without any other Party members playing dominos on it).

Unsuccessful branches result in the monster damaging the Party member and 2 dominos being discarded (randomly selected by the Hunt Master).

#### Stakes

Each successful **Branch** resolves a **Stake** that the Party member had previously established. If a **Steak** was shared between more than one Party member, either may resolve it for both or all of them with a single successful **Branch**.


#### The Trail

During this phase, the **Trail** is closed. No further dominos may be played directly on the main **Trail**, and no new stakes may be established.

#### Ending Phase

When the double 12 domino is found and played, the monster has been defeated. This phase ends when the monster is defeated or all of the Party has perished. If the entire Party has perished, the game ends here. If the monster is defeated, the game progresses to the Epilogue phase.

When the party looks behind at the ruins of the struggle with the monster, they will see the wreckage of any hopes or investments that were left behind. Any unresolved **Stakes** are lost, and the Hunt Master describes how the ruin left in the wake of the monster has destroyed these fragile things.

## Epilogue Phase

During the Epilogue phase, the surviving Party members wrap up the story by describing scenes with the aftermath of the monster battle, the effects on the town, and the future for their characters.

### Setup

Return all the dominos from the **Trail** and all branches to the **Void**.

### Play

Starting with the player who has the most dominos (and breaking ties as before), each Party member takes turns returning any unused dominos from their hand to the **Void**.

With each one they describe a brief scene about their character or the village. Similar to the initial domino set down by the Hunt Master at the start of the game, the numbers on the domino determine the tone of the scene. If both sides of the domino are 8 or above, it is indisputably a positive scene. If both numbers are 7 or below, some unfortunate (but mundane) event is taking place. If the numbers are mixed, things are somewhere in between.

When all the dominos have been returned to the **Void**, the game is finished.
