    A key to the obstacle is a tree
    A second-order key is an axe, which must be used on the tree before the tree can be used to bridge the river

## Indication and Action

A character may perform two types of actions

- Indicate
- Act

To indicate, a character declares what they are indicating.  
	a key, in their posession.  or at their location.  or elsewhere?
	an obstacle at their location. or elsewhere?
	context of what they indicate and where determines possible actions

To Act, a character responds to the indication of another character.

A character can not take *Action* on their own initiative

Instead, a character must *Indicate* an Obstacle or a Key.  Then, another character with a relevant ability can *Act* following the first character's *Indication*.
