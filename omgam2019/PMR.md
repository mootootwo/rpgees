# Pocket Monster Rancher

You operate a stable monsters that train for tournaments and compete for prizes.

This game uses Fudge dice, notated as dF.  Fudge dice (dF) have an equal number of Plus, Blank, and Minus sides which are noted as `[+]`, `[_]`, and `[-]`.


## Turn Activities

Each turn, choose one of the following three activities:

**Capture a Monster**

Perform this activity to obtain a new monster for your stable.  Roll 1dF for each of

- Speed
- Brawn
- Mind

For each, record `[+]` as +1, `[_]` as 0, and `[-]` as -1.

Roll 1dF to determine the monster's age.  On a roll of `[_]` record the age as 5.  On a roll of `[+]` increate the age by one and record it as 6.  On a roll of `[-]` decrease the age by one and record it 4.

**Train a Monster**

You must have at least one monster in your stable to perform this activity.  Choose a monster to train, and choose one of two training methods:

- You may choose the ability (Speed, Brawn, or Mind) to train.  Roll 1dF and on `[+]` or `[_]` increase the ability by one
- Improve a randomly selected ability by one.  Roll 1dF and on `[+]` improve Speed.  On `[_]` improve Brawn.  On `[-]` improve Mind

**Breed two Monsters**

You must have at least two monsters in your stable to perform this activity.  Choose two of your monsters to breed, and average their ages (rounding fractions).

Roll 2dF and increase the average age by one for each `[+]` and decrease it by one for each `[-]`.  If the result is less than 7, an offspring is successfully produced.
	
Determine the abilities of the offspring by averaging each pair of the parents abilities (Speed and Speed, for example) and rounding fractions.

For each averaged pair of abilities, roll 1dF.  For each `[+]` increase the result by one and decrease it by one for each `[-]`.  

If the ability of both parents is greater than 0, ignore any `[-]` result.

If the ability of both parents is less than 0, ignore any `[+]` result.

Record the age of the new monster as 0.

## Tournaments

Every third turn, a tournament occurs.  

Choose one of your monsters to compete against others.  

Use any style of elimination bracket appropriate to the number of contestants, and give _byes_ as needed to the monsters with the highest combined sum of their abilities.

When two monsters face off in competition, roll 1dF to determine how the terrain affects the match:

- On a `[+]` the terrain is _Plains_ and Speed is doubled
- On a `[_]` the terrain is _Woods_ and Brawn is doubled
- On a `[-]` the terrain is _Urban_ and Mind is doubled

Secretly choose which ability to compete with.  Both competitors reveal their choice at the same time, and compare.

- In a contest of Speed and Brawn, Brawn is doubled
- In a contest of Speed and Mind, Speed is doubled
- In a contest of Brawn and Mind, Mind is doubled

In the event of a tie, each contestant must secretly choose a different ability to compete with and compare again according to the process above.  

In the event of a furhter tie, compare the final set of abilities.  If after all three sets produce ties, then the match may be considered a draw if the elimination bracket allows.  Otherwise, dice-off to determine a winner.
	
Continue competitions between pairs of monsters until the tournament is complete.

Award a trophy to the stable of the winning monster.

The winning monster has a chance to improve one of its abilities.  
Roll 1dF, and on `[+]` or `[_]` an ability improves by two.  
Roll 1dF to determine which ability is affected: on `[+]` improve Speed.  On `[_]` improve Brawn.  On `[-]` improve Mind.

All other monsters that took place in the tournament have a chance to affect an ability in a positive or negative way.  
For each monster, roll 1dF.  On `[+]` an ability will improve by one.  On `[_]` an ability will decrease by one.  
Roll 1dF to determine which ability is affected: on `[+]` change Speed.  On `[_]` change Brawn.  On `[-]` change Mind.

After the tournament is complete, increase the age of all monsters in your stable by 1.  If any monster's age is greater than 10, it is retired and removed from your stable.

## Trophies

At any time, the stable with the most trophies is the stable with the most trophies.  This means they have more trophies than other stables.
