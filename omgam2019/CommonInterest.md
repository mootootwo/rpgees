# Common Interest

A game of shared goals and competing interests

## Setup

	Each player has their own interest
	The group of all players shares a common interest
	Progress for each interest begins at zero

## Each turn, 

	The group receives a pool of 2d per player in the group
	Each player's interest is confronted with 1d opposition or setback
	Group's interest is confronted with 1d per player, in total (including any players whom  have left the group)
	
	Select a leader for the group
	The leader decides how to divide the pool of dice between players
	Each player decides to spend their die in either
		Their interest (hold it)
		Another players interest (pass it to them)
		The group's interest (pool it in the middle)
	
	Each player rolls the dice that they have, and sums against their opposition die
	The leader rolls the dice for the group, and sums against the group opposition
	Update the progress for each interest

## Leaving the group

	A player may leave the group at any time.  
	
	When a player leaves the group, any players remaining in the group may choose to assign a negative die to the leaving player's interest.
	
	Roll the negative dice and sum with the player's current progress, recording the new and final total.
	
	If the progress is greater than or equal to the total number of players, the goal has been successfully achieved.  The margin describes the degree of success or failure.

## Disbanding the group

	When the group disbands, meaning it has no remaining members, evaluate the group's progress.
	

If the group's progress is greater than or equal to twice the total number of players, the goal has been successfully achieved.  The margin describes the degree of success or failure.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25321484/114842169-81b7d900-9dd0-11eb-8d7a-8d4c1d8b2b53.png)
